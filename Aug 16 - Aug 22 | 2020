Slice vs Splice : FCC Article
Slicing cuts elements out of array - but does not cut actual array - stays unmodified
Splice does ops in place - also used to add elements

arr.slice(start, [end])
arr.splice(start, [delteCount, itemToInsert1, itemToInsert3, ...])

both: if start is -ve, elements counted from end - array returns with the deleted items

sl: if end is omitted, end becomes end(last element) of the array
sp: if deleteCount is omitted, elements until the end of the array are removed

" Array.prototype.slice() : Array.prototype.splice() "
TLDR : Slice array stays unmodified - Splice array is modified
